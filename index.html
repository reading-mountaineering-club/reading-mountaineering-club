          We are a friendly and active group of people who are passionate about
          climbing, walking, and scrambling; the range of abilities is wide. Our
          activities include regular climbing at Parthian on Wednesday evenings
          or the Climbing Hangar, regular meets away, and local socials. The
          club has a lively atmosphere and is a good way to meet like-minded
          people.
        </p>

          Usually the meets list covers monthly trips to areas such as the
          Lakes, North Wales, Peak district, Gower, Pembrokeshire, and Cornwall.
          We would typically camp or stay in a hut. The club provides a perfect
          forum, through its Facebook site and WhatsApp group, for organising
          additional trips.
